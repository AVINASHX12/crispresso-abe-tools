Supplementary Methods: Custom tool for CRISPResso output parsing
CRISPResso2 outputs were initially inspected for base-edit summaries. To extract positional A->G conversion frequencies efficiently, we developed two complementary tools: (i) a command-line parser (crispresso_abe_efficiency.py) for batch processing of CRISPResso2_base_edits.txt files and (ii) an interactive GUI (crispresso_abe_gui_clean.py) for exploratory analysis. Both tools parse CRISPResso2 summary tables and generate per-sample, per-position summary tables used for downstream analyses and plotting. The scripts do not modify raw sequencing data and are available from the authors upon request; the source code is deposited at [GitHub URL] to ensure reproducibility.
